# MachineLearningProject
In this project, I created a neural net from scratch using gradient descent with 4 different loss functions, the perceptron algorithm, and linear programmming to classify linearly classifiable data. Tested the the time and success rate and created a report. 

In addition, I coded various algorithms that classified non-linearly separable data tested their efficiency and accuracy. 

This includes using mapping input to feature space to use linear programming and linear algorithms. In my project, I mapped each instance of data x to a feature space such that

This allows me to create larger weight vectors to classify the data.

Report shows test results using Perceptron, Linprog, Hard-SVM, and Soft-SVM on both linear and non-linearly classifiable data.

On Support Vector Machine (SVM), quadratic programming with Hard-SVM, linear programming algorithms using feature mapping Kernels functions. 

Neural nets & Soft-SVM using Gaussian Kernel successfully classified data.
