# MachineLearningProject
In this project, I created a neural net from scratch using gradient descent with 4 different loss functions, the perceptron algorithm, and linear programmming to classify linearly classifiable data. Tested the the time and success rate and created a report. 

In addition, I coded various algorithms that classified non-linearly separable data tested their efficiency and accuracy. 

This includes using mapping input to feature space to use linear programming and linear algorithms. EX: Input [1, x1, x2] gets mapped to [1, x1, x2, x2/x1, x1/x2, x1x2], allowing us to use more weight vectors.

Report shows test results using Perceptron, Linprog, Hard-SVM, and Soft-SVM on both linear and non-linearly classifiable data.

On Support Vector Machine (SVM), quadratic programming with Hard-SVM, linear programming algorithms using feature mapping Kernels functions. 

Neural nets & Soft-SVM using Gaussian Kernel successfully classified data.
